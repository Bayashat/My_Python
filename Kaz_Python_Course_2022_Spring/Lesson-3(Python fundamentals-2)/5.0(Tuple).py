print(my_tuple)


                ###### 2. Tuple items
# Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index[0] etc.

                ####  3. Ordered
# when we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order are not changable

            ###### 4. Allow duplicates

            # len()

            ###   6. Create tuple with one item
